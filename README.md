This project uses a minimal Express setup with the native MongoDB driver to keep dependencies light and performance optimal.
The `/users/:id` endpoint ensures clean validation of user input, filters by `age > 21`, and responds with appropriate HTTP status codes.
The code is structured for clarity and ease of extension.
